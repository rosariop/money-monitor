# Money-Monitor

This project should help tracking and categorizing personal spendings.
The code is written by a non-professional GoLang dev so code style might be all over the place.

TODOs:
- [ ] Copy CSV Data into Database
- [ ] Normalize tables
- [ ] Simple "View By Account"-View
- [ ] Add Categories
- [ ] Categorize payee
- [ ] Re-Categorize payment
- [ ] Visualize Spending
